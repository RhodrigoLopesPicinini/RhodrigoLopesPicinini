:desktop_computer: About my technical development...

Now I'm just searching for something to stick with it. I'm curious about a lot of things regarding to software development! So what am I doing right now?

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning HTML5

:world_map: What am I planning to do?

- :mountain: Learn more about Web Development and Its meaning
- :mountain: Learn about HTML CSS JavaScript in separated ways
- :mountain: Start small projects into Front-end sites using everything I learned on the way

ðŸ¤” More about myself...

So, my full name is Rhodrigo Lopes Picinini, I'm a Brazilian computer scientist student at Atitus EducaÃ§Ã£o and I'm still searching to something to catch my eye in Software Development! I'm always more prone to visual things, so I'm taking on a Web Dev side of things, more specifically Front-end development, but I am also interested in Game Development. 

:pencil2: Btw I'm also learning how to draw figures and life drawings, so as you can see I'm a visual guy :wink:

:hearts: My likings in a simple way:
- :computer: Software development related to visual things
- :exclamation: I'm also into Game Development but is not my priority
- :art: I like to draw a lot of things, more specifically gestures and backgrounds!
- :video_game: I play a lot of games too! It's a hobby of mine
